# virtual-painter
A virtual painting app created by using Python and OpenCV


I created this application following a tutorial

I then added my own modification which was to create a window that allows the user to modify the color of which to track
This was because I had trouble getting my paint to show on the output screen so I needed an easy way to modify it without having to directly hard code it
